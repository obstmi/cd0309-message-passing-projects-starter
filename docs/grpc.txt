The gRPC messaging strategy is used internally in the kubernetes cluster to get all persons from the 'persons'-microservices.
It is currently used by the 'find_contacts'-method of the 'ConnectionService' of the 'connections'-microservice.  
So - if looking for the connections of a person in the frontend, gRPC is implicitely called to transfer of all persons data.

To test the service use Postman and generate a request to http://localhost:30010/ using the 'person.proto' service definition.
